# JunkDJ
JunkDJ is a recycled music station consists of two main components-a rotary phone and an instrumental keypad. The rotary phone plays background music and the instrumental keypad plays light and sound effects. JunkDJ is made of components from old and obsolete devices such as a rotary phone and an old home telephone combining with modern components such as micro-controllers (Arduino), an MP3 player shield, an LED ring, and Bluetooth components.This project aims to 

build a device that everyone can enjoy playing and making music without knowledge around music and technology. It can also be used for reflecting and expressing feelings of users.
